# MovieApp
A Django-based web application for movie selection from a MySQL database depending on viewer preferences, such as genre or other criteria.

# Set-up
Will require configuring a database, for my project, I used MySQL. I provided some test data files in [Test_Data](https://github.com/PaigeCrossley/MovieApp/tree/main/Test_Data) to show the table format and entity relationships.
Environment variables can be configured in the [.env]([moviepicker\moviepicker\.env](https://github.com/PaigeCrossley/MovieApp/blob/main/moviepicker/moviepicker/.env)) file.
[Requirements](https://github.com/PaigeCrossley/MovieApp/blob/main/requirements.txt) file is included as well.

# This Project is Still Under Construction
Currently, it is fully functional, however, there are several improvements I plan to make in the future.

1. Enhance the visual appeal of the application
2. Add priority to selecting movies that meet multiple genre criteria
3. Add NLP functionality for a more flexible selection process
